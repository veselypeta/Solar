1.  Add Data logging features to know how to log data from the simulation which can then later be analysed
    so that the experiments results can be calculated.

2.  Important might be phase angle relative to other planets. This can probably just be calculated from position.

3.  Think of how you would experiment with a satellite. It might be useful to calculate a speed, then actually create a
    satellite with that velocity, place it in the simulation and see if it reaches mars. The data can be analysed
    to see how close it got. Probably the most simple way of finding the path is to use Hohmann transfers. A delta
    V can be calculated to take the apehelion of the orbit to the radius of mars. Then you can calculate how long it
    take to fly there from earth. Then you can calculate the phase angle at which mars must be so you arrive at the
    same time.
